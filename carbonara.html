    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
    <P>
        Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
    </P>
    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
    <p>
        Finely chop the 100g Guanciale, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
    <p>
        Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
    <p>
        Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghettoni and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</p>
    <h3>STEP 5</h3>
    <p>
        While the spaghettoni is cooking, fry the Guanciale at low heat to make it lose the fat. Leave to cook at low heat until the Guanciale is golden and crisp.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 6</h3>
    <p>
        Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don't throw the pasta water away yet.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 6</h3>
    <p>
        Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 7</h3>
    <p>
        Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 8</h3>
    <p>
        Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don't want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 9</h3>
    <p>
        Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
    </p>
    <h3>STEP 10</h3>
    <p>
        ENJOY!...E ora si mangia!
